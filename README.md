# Code Quiz!

## Description

This a code quiz currently giving five questions on javascript. To start the game, first click "Ok" on the prompt "Welcome to Code Quiz" then press the **START** button. You are given 3 minutes (*180 sec total*) to complete the quiz with as high a score as possible. For every question you answer correctly, you get 20 points added to your score. For every question you answer incorrectly, 20 seconds will be deducted from your overall time. You will have the option to save your score and initials at end of the game.

--This one is a work in progress. The timer has a bug somewhere in this code. It probably needs a clearInterval() in one of the function bodies. However, I've been focusing on other projects so that I haven't yet taken the time to resolve that. Also, I did not prepare this to save just yet to one's local computer. If you feel you're up to the challenge and want to clone it down yourself, you are welcome to do so.
